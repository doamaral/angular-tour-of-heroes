# Project
This project is part of [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes) to generate a first contact with Angular.

# Environment Setup
## Requirements

## Angular CLI
Angular CLI do a lot of boilerplating for us... so let's install it
- `npm install -g @angular/cli` you might need to do run it as `sudo`

# Initial project Setup
- `ng new`
- `ng new <project's name>`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
